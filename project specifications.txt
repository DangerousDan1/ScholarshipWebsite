**we're building the website for one entity that can look through applicants that have
  applied. We will list the scholarships that they are offering once the applicant logs in

HOME PAGE:
	-should show welcome page and what the site is about then have sign up and login 
	 options
	-sign up as admin...or maybe there should be only one admin account since it's for
	 one organization so then there's no need to even have the option to sign up as
	 admin

USER:
*when you sign up:
	-first name
	-last name
	-email
	-password
*once you log in:
	-the applicant will be able to see available scholarships---maybe we can do a 
	checkbox of the onces that they want to apply to
	-once they click apply:
		:we need fields like first name, last name, age, ethnicity, parent's marital status,
		text field for essay
	-a page that shows their own information
	-upload a picture(MAYBE)
	-sms login(MAYBE)

ADMIN:
*needs to see all users
*needs to see the user's information when they click on user's name
*download a file that contains the user's information(MAYBE)
*needs to see all the scholarships the user wants to apply to
